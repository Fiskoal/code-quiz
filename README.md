# code-quiz

Unfortunately, I did not have nearly as much time as I usually do to work on this assignment.

I took my usual step-by-step approach to this, going at it one chunk at a time and piecing it together.

First, I made sure to lay out all the elements that I would need to insert other elements into with Javascript. Most of the project was done with Javascript.

I started calling all the variables and function names I thought I would need.

I got to work making the buttons remove elements and add elements on click.

I needed a way to check if the button clicked was the correct answer, so I added classes to each of them. I used the classes ("w" and "a") to set click events, so the script would know if it was right or wrong.

Next, I got started on the timer. This was easy enough, I just had a timeInterval for 1000 seconds changing a variable I have set for seconds, and have the text content for the timer on the page be the value of the seconds variable.

I managed to get the quiz itself working, including the timer and scores system, but ran into issues with localStorage and ran out of time to complete this assignment. Given enough time I would feel much more comfortable finishing this, as it felt completely rushed.
